    none of the information from configuration files; report interface
    type; report all addresses assigned to an interface; report MAC address
    of an interface
  - ncf_list_interfaces, ncf_num_interfaces, ncf_if_xml_state: fix bugs
    when dealing with interfaces that are down
  - ncf_if_mac_string: do not report error when MAC is not known, simply
    return NULL
  - use libnl to determine information about live interfaces

0.1.2 - 2009-09-25

  - ncf_define: fix removal of old interface config before redefining it
  - ncf_define: do not crash when defining a VLAN interface without a name
    (commit fb0543cc)

  - toplevel interfaces are no longer required to have an address
